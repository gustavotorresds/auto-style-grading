# Automating Code Style Grading
In the introductory series of Computer Science, Section Leaders spend a disproportionate amount of time grading students on style, and thatâ€™s a huge bottleneck for how many students the school can handle. We want to investigate how a machine learning approach could be used to automate the process of style grading coding assignments

## Data
Our algorithm (run it, look into `main.py`) depends on a folder called **data** at the root level. We omitted the data from the repo. If you are interested, email gdasilva@stanford.edu.

## TO-DOs
* Feature extraction is still naive. Look into more meaningful information to extract from samples of code
* Look into models that are more appropriate for our context.
