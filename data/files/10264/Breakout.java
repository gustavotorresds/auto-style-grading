 * This file will eventually implement the game of Breakout, with the extension
 * so that it gives the player instructions to click the screen to start playing
 * the game so that instead of just shooting the ball out, it waits for the player 
 * to indicate that they are ready by waiting for the screen to be clicked in order 
 * to put the ball in motion. Another extension is and with the extension the 
 * attached audio clip that makes a bounce noise when	 the ball hits either the 
 * paddle or one of the bricks.
